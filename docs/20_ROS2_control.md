### Introduction:
Today's tutorial addresses a common challenge in robotics: **Control**. Control is what makes a robot a robot. Whether it’s motors, hydraulics, or other actuators, without control input, calculation, and the ability to drive actuators, it’s not a robot. There are various actuators, interfaces, and control methodologies, but most share commonalities. To avoid rewriting code every time, we need a standardized system to manage various hardware interfaces and control methods: **ros2_control**.

### Problem Overview:
When starting a project, you might consider using ROS topics to handle hardware drivers and controllers by passing standard messages. While this approach can work for some cases, the need for **speed** arises. ROS topics can be fast but not fast enough for direct control. 

**ros2_control** solves this by providing a robust framework that handles hardware interfaces, controllers, and the interaction between them, ensuring that control commands can happen with minimal delay.

### Key Concepts of ros2_control:

1. **Controller Manager**:  
   This is the central manager that links together hardware interfaces and controllers. Each controller or hardware interface is loaded dynamically at runtime via a plugin system.

2. **Hardware Interfaces**:  
   - **Command Interfaces**: Things you can control (like velocity, position).
   - **State Interfaces**: Things you can measure (like velocity, position, torque).  
   In the example, two command interfaces (velocity control) and four state interfaces (velocity and position) are used. The interface abstracts the hardware so ros2_control doesn’t need to know if it’s dealing with a differential drive robot or an arm.

3. **Resource Manager**:  
   Combines all hardware interfaces and exposes them to controllers, simplifying the process of matching command and state interfaces. The hardware interfaces are defined in the **URDF** file under the ros2_control tag.

4. **Controllers**:  
   - Designed to receive inputs from ROS topics, calculate the required motor positions, speeds, or other parameters, and send commands to hardware interfaces. 
   - For differential robots, there is a **diff_drive_controller**. Controllers are configured using YAML files.

5. **Execution Models**:  
   - ros2_control can be run by embedding the **Controller Manager** in your own node or using pre-built nodes provided by ros2_control.
   - It is essential to define hardware and controller configurations (via URDF and YAML).

6. **Interaction with ros2_control**:  
   - Use ROS services and the **ros2_control** command-line tool to start, stop, and interact with controllers.

### Practical Implementation in Gazebo:

To put theory into practice, we’ll simulate a differential drive robot in Gazebo using ros2_control. This section will guide through updating URDF, adding controller configurations, and launching a gazebo simulation with ros2_control.

**Steps:**

1. **Install Required Packages:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt install ros-foxy-ros2-control ros-foxy-ros2-controllers ros-foxy-gazebo-ros2-control
    ```

2. **URDF Update**:
    Replace the gazebo controller tags in the URDF with the ros2_control tag. Here's how the **ros2_control** tag looks:
    ```xml
    <ros2_control name="gazebo_system" type="system">
      <hardware>
        <plugin>gazebo_ros2_control/GazeboSystem</plugin>
      </hardware>
      <joint name="left_wheel_joint">
        <command_interface name="velocity"/>
        <state_interface name="velocity"/>
        <state_interface name="position"/>
      </joint>
      <joint name="right_wheel_joint">
        <command_interface name="velocity"/>
        <state_interface name="velocity"/>
        <state_interface name="position"/>
      </joint>
    </ros2_control>
    ```

3. **Add YAML Controller Configuration**:
    Create a `my_controllers.yaml` file:
    ```yaml
    controller_manager:
      ros__parameters:
        update_rate: 30
        use_sim_time: true
        diff_drive_controller:
          type: diff_drive_controller/DiffDriveController
          left_wheel_names: ["left_wheel_joint"]
          right_wheel_names: ["right_wheel_joint"]
          publish_rate: 50
          base_frame_id: base_link
          wheel_separation: 0.35
          wheel_radius: 0.05
        joint_state_broadcaster:
          type: joint_state_broadcaster/JointStateBroadcaster
    ```

4. **Launch Gazebo Simulation**:
    Modify your Gazebo launch file to include the ros2_control plugin and controllers. Launch the simulation to see ros2_control in action:
    ```bash
    ros2 launch my_robot_gazebo my_robot_gazebo.launch.py
    ```

### Summary:
This tutorial provides an overview of **ros2_control**, its components, and practical steps to integrate it into a simulation using Gazebo. **ros2_control** simplifies managing hardware interfaces and controllers, making it easier to build flexible, reusable robotic systems.
